# Neural_Networks

This repository is a structure for storing all the neural netowrks that i create and train.
All neural networks are/will be created and trained using the PyTorch Library. 

Each Neural Network is stored inside its own folder containing a explanation for functions i have used inside the NN code.
Check README.md inside the folder of each NN for code explanation.

Created Neural Nets:
1. [Handwriting_Digit_Recognition_MNIST](https://github.com/taizun-jj202/Neural_Networks/tree/digit_recog/Handwriting_Digit_Recognition_NN)
2. [K-Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/taizun-jj202/Neural_Networks/tree/algorithms/KNN)
3. [Linear_Regression Algorithm](https://github.com/taizun-jj202/Neural_Networks/tree/algorithms/Linear_Regression)
4. [Logistic_Regression Algorithm](https://github.com/taizun-jj202/Neural_Networks/tree/algorithms/Logistic_Regression)
