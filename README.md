# Neural_Networks

This repository is a structure for storing all the neural netowrks that i create and train.
All neural networks are/will be created and trained using the PyTorch Library. 

Each Neural Network is stored inside its own folder containing a explanation for functions i have used inside the NN code.
Check EXPLANATION.md for explanation of code for each NN individually.

Created Neural Nets:
1. [Digit Recognizer](https://github.com)
